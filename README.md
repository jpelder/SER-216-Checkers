# SER-216-Checkers
Group 15 Final Project: Editing given Checkers game

CHANGES MADE BEFORE INITIAL PUSH TO GITHUB: Some of the image file names had to be edited

3/21/17: As of now you must copy all images to the class (bin) folder to run the game correctly. Working on a fix

3/28/17: Copied the image folder into bin and edited references. This makes it so no changes need to be done to start the game, but I still wish I could move the image folder up by one directory. Unexpectedly, this altered the Start Game screen by adding a lot of stuff. Edited a few text fields.

4/3/17: Moved Folders around and deleted duplicate folders/files. Changed references to sound files to make them work. Added a file (HowToPlay.is) to populate the Help Box.

4/5/17: Cleaned up the code - adding/moving brackets, spacing,  etc. Added our group names to the credits in the beginning, and some button tool tips.

4/6/17: Cleaned up code - spacing.
